# Image_Classification_Project
This project involves creating a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of fruits and vegetables into various categories using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained, validated, and tested on datasets of images of fruits and vegetables and is capable of classifying new images with a high degree of accuracy.
